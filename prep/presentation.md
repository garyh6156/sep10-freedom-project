# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* Did you know there is different kind of animation in the world

## Product
* gifs/link to my MVP

## Process
* In my part A of research,l researched different kind of animation and tool and had exist in today world. First l start to google website and then l watch a video. In part B of my research, l brainstorm different type of technology in the future, like Automated Tasks and Hybrid Animation. I start to learn my tool and then l test out Aframe to make a 3D animation.

## Conclusion
* Use time management when you are doing a project because it really gonna help you save your time and you know what you gonna do in each day. Unlike me sometime l was having a problem on what to do someday

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
