## Content 
During my expo elevator pitch persent, the takeaways that l get was to add more thing to my website and like explain more about my website because l kind finish my presentation in less than one minute. And in my [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eTj1ZEbL6xBduCDBzt4pM3PUHu6otURj4uLvgYoKAuU/mobilepresent?slide=id.p) in class of my website, the takeaway I got was that I need to speak louder most of the student can't hear me when I'm presenting so next time I need to speak louder and prepare more about presentation.


## Engineering Desigh Process 
Now l am in "7 Improve as needed" because right now I have a lot to improve for example my website I need to add more information and details about animation and presentation to be more comfortable to present.

## Skill 
How to learn was a skill to help you learn things. For me, I used how to learn to know more about animation, and it's also help you learn by yourself at home and the second skill was Collaboration I use this when I'm stuck for example, when I was doing my website, I was stuck on a code that is keep bugging so I asked my friend to help me to debug it.



## Takeaway
That you can record your presentation the day before you put so you can know what you can do better than any mistake.
