##### 5/11/25

## Content
Frist l plan out how my MVP should look in mobile and computer with wireframes and then after l get a 10/10 on my wireframes l start to plan what should the color and font look like and what code should l use. After l finish all this l start to code out my project. And l was using [studiobinder](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-animation-definition/) to help me learn what is animation and different kind and animation.

## Challenges
One challenges that l face was that to make the text goes to the right and make it keep less space because when l try to make the text goes to the right it did not, but l decided to google up video to watch and ask my friend, now it on the right and take less  space.
### The code:
* `<div id="future" style="float: right; margin-top: 120px; margin-left: 20px; text-align: left;></div>`
* `<div style="max-width: 800px;"></div>`


## EDP
I think l am in improve because l am trying to improve my MVP webiste to make it look better and imrpove the information in the webiste.


## Skills
* The first skill was Problem Decimposition because it can help you to see where is the problem and makes you more easy to fix a problem with step when it get broke into pieces.
* The second skill was Time Management because in MVP you really needed to use your time so you can use time management to help you that what you gonna do in these day for example, you plan out a schedule to show you what you gonna do in monday to friday.



## Professionalism
when you are doing a project you really should use time management so you are not lost like me in somedays.
